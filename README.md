# Project Mesto frontend + backend
The Mesto app is an educational interactive page where you can add photos, delete them and like them. The following technologies were used in the project:
- Creating a server using Express
- Working with NoSQL database using MongoDB as an example
- Mongoose (creating schemas and models)
- Middleware
- Using routes and controllers to structure code

## With the help of these technologies, the functional of the project was implemented:

- Getting data about users
- User creation
- Update user profile and avatar
- Obtaining data of all user cards
- Create and delete new custom cards
- Possibility to like and unlike the card
